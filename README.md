# My-Secret-Mode
This is a normal option in practically all mobile phones in Japan. I've seen a few that kinda but not really do what the ones in Japan mobile phones can do.  I want to design one better and hopefully implement in all mobile phones domestic and foreign. 
I want to also say I'm new to all of this so please bare with me if I make alot of mistakes I typed a whole read me for this and i thought it saved the text. Well it didn't mistake number one. Ugh and I don't have time to try and type it again. The info below is Ai inspired and written by Ai.  
The mobile phones of early 2000s Japan were indeed ahead of their time, often featuring advanced technology that would not become standard in other parts of the world until much later. These devices, known for their innovative features, were part of a unique 'keitai culture' that thrived on novelty and functionality. For instance, the integration of a camera and the ability to send photos via messaging, introduced with the J-SH04 model by Sharp, was a revolutionary step in mobile technology. Additionally, features like mobile internet browsing, email, and even contactless payment systems were commonplace in Japanese mobile phones long before they were adopted globally. This forward-thinking approach to mobile phone technology not only set the standard for future developments but also created a distinct mobile phone culture that influenced the global market. The 'Secret Mode' you recall could have included various privacy and security features, such as password-protected areas, hidden contact lists, or private browsing options, which were precursors to the modern smartphone's privacy settings. Japan's pioneering role in mobile technology during this era is a testament to the country's innovative spirit and its impact on the world.
